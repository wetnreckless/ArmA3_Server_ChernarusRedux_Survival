Server Mods:
- @exileserver                (included in this repo)
- @infiSTAR                   (you will need to get your own copy for this. I will include intrustions on how to run server without it.)
- @A3XAI                      (included in this repo) Version I modified can be located here (https://github.com/Porkeld/A3xai-2.3)

1.  So before you go making any changes to your server, please make sure that you have a working Exile server in its original state (vanilla). If you do not know how to get a vanilla server running, here is a complet guide that I have used in the past.

2.  Make sure that the server is running extDB3 (https://github.com/SteezCram/extDB3) This guide will not work without it.
